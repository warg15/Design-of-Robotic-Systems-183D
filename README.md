Proj 1: Hardware set-up, including wireless ESP chip link to computer, and calibration of sensors 

Proj 2: Extended Kalman Filter for robot localization 

Proj 3: Markov Decision Processes: Value iteration and Policy Iteration 

Proj 4: Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) for path navigation from starting state to goal state, avoiding enviornmental obstacles.

FaceID and Launhcer Project: 
Designed a robot that had a structure that was completely 3D-prinatble. Robot responded to a remote input and determined if a human face was in view, then located the human face using a camera and OpenCV libraries. It performed the necessary trajectory calculations and then used on-board motors, infared and LiDAR sensors to determine the distance to target and then adjust itself to the correct state before launching a desirable candy to the human target.
